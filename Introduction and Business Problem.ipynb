He would like the restaurant to be located in a neighbourhood of North York (e.g. Parkwoods, Victoria Village, etc.) that has the fewest number of restaurants as a common venue.\n\nThe reasoning for his decision is that, a neighbourhood with fewer restaurants will attract more customers to his restaurants, therefore bringing in more businesses."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data Requirements\n\n### 1. I will need a list of neighbourhoods in North York.\n* I will obtain a list of neighbourhoods in North York through this URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M \n* I will create a dataframe containing a list of neighbourhoods in North York, as well as their postal codes, latitudes, and longitudes.\n\n### 2. I will need to explore and analyze neighbourhoods in North York.\n* I will use Foursquare data to segment and cluster neighbourhoods in North York.\n* In particular, I will find out the most common venues of each neighbourhood in North York.\n* For example, I want to find out if Parkwoods or Victoria Village would have \"cafes\", \"deli\", \"Italian restaurants\", or \"doughnut shops\" listed as their top 10 most common venues.\n\n### 3. Gathering data and Determining Business Action\n* Through the above steps, I should be able to obtain a list of top 10 most common venues for all neighbourhoods in North York.\n* I can then count how many times an eatery (e.g. \"cafes\", \"deli\", \"Italian restaurants\", or \"doughnut shops\") appears as a most common venue for each neighbourhood.\n* The best neighbourhood for my client to open his Japanese restaurant would be the neighbourhood with the least count of an eatery as a most common venue."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
